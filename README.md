# Documentation
This repo is one of my experiment trying to learn THREE js and how 3D works on the web. I used a tutorial from fireship and its provided repo to learn the basics.

## My Plan
Here is a breakdown of how I want to accomplish

1. Try to read and understand what the different sections of the code does.
2. Watch the tutorial to get an explanation on things I do not understand.
3. Try to customize the project with the same pattern of code
4. Try to extend the project with concepts I learn and Ideas I get from the Threejs documentation. (E.g: Texture mapping, Geometry, scenes, and more...)
5. Learn how to use models I find on the internet
6. Learn how to animate on scroll. (Use wawa sensei repo)
7. Create a second page where I will implement my own ideas
